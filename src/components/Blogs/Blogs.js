                        <p>Authorization is the process to determine whether the authenticated user has access to the particular resources. It verifies your rights to grant you access to resources such as information, databases, files, etc. Authorization usually comes after authentication which confirms your privileges to perform. In simple terms, itâ€™s like giving someone official permission to do something or anything.</p>
                        <span className='fw-bolder'>Authentication:</span>
                        <p>Authentication is about validating your credentials like User Name/User ID and password to verify your identity. The system determines whether you are what you say you are using your credentials.In public and private networks, the system authenticates the user identity via login passwords. Authentication is usually done by a username and password.</p>
